# Algorithms and Data Structures 

This repository contains my early C++ programming assignments for the college course Algorithms and Data Structures.

## 📁 Project Structure

### starter tasks

Contains the introductory tasks:
- task_1.cpp — first task  
- task_2.cpp — second task  
- task_3.cpp — third task  
- task_4.cpp — fourth task  
- task_5.cpp — fifth task  

### separate compilation
This folder demonstrates separate compilation in C++ and contains:
- main.cpp
- main.o
- func.cpp
- func.o
- program

The program is split into multiple source files:
- One file (main.cpp) contains the main() function  
- Another file (func.cpp) contains the implementation of a separate function  

Steps performed in this task:
- Each .cpp file is compiled into its own object file (`.o`)
- Then all object files are linked into one final executable program

This shows how real multi-file programs are built.

### task from 19.11.25
Tasks assigned on 19.11:
- task_1.cpp - first task
- task_2.cpp - second task

tasks 3-10 in progress =)


## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

2. Navigate to the folder with the task you want to run:
   ```sh
cd starter tasks

or:
sh
cd separate compilation

or:
sh
cd tasks from 19.11.25

Compile the program:
sh
g++ file.cpp -o program
Run it:

sh
./program

For separate compilation:
sh
g++ main.o func.o -o program
sh
./program


## 🧠 Purpose of This Repository

- To store and organize my college programming tasks

- To practice writing clean and structured C++ code

- To demonstrate my learning progress

- To keep all tasks in one safe place

## 📝 Notes

- Mistakes are part of the process.
- If something breaks — that’s completely normal.
- If everything works on the first try — that’s magic.
