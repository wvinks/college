# Starter tasks for the course "Algorithms and Data Structures"

This repository contains my first programming assignments (C++) from college.

Each file corresponds to a separate task.

# Project structure

task_1.cpp — code of the first task

task_2.cpp — code of the second task

task_3.cpp — code of the third task

task_4.cpp — code of the fourth task

task_5.cpp — code of the fifth task (in progress)

# How to run
Install a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

Compile the required file:
g++ task_1.cpp -o task1

Run the program:
./task1

# Note

This is a learning repository created for practicing and completing the first assignments in C++.
